### Requirements
##### The calculator only evaluates a single pair of numbers at a time
For example, 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = should yield 42.

##### The calculator allow inputs up to 10 characters
This includes decimal place, so the input range is 0.00000001 to 9999999999.

##### Decimal points
If more than one decimal point is pressed, the calculator ignore the latter decimal point(s).

##### The calculator calculates displays results up to 11 characters
This includes decimal place, so the result range is 0.000000001 to 99999999999.
- If the result is a long decimal number, the result will display the first 11 characters.
- If the result is a long integer number, the result will display the first 11 characters and '...'.

##### When an operator is pressed
The current operator will be highlighted.
